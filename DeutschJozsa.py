# Deutsch Jozsa Algorithm
#
# The Deutsch Jozsa algorithm is a generalisation of the Deutschâ€™s algorithm.
# The goal is still to determine if a function is balanced or constant.
# The difference is that there can be more than 1 input to the oracle function.
# Note that the inputs to the function is guaranteed to be constant or balanced.
#
# + Model the quantum states of the Detusch Jozsa algorithm
# + Support n input qubits
# + The output qubit is not modelled as its effect is handled in the phase inversion
