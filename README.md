# QuantumPlayground
Quantum Playground is an open source project containing textbook examples of quantum algorithms in python. 

The algorithms implemented manually without quantum libraries in order to explore and learn their 
core mathematical properties, behaviour and intermingling with classical computational models. 

They are also implemented in Qiskit so we can experiment running the algorithms on simulators 
and actual quantum hardware.
